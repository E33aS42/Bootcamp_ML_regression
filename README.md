# Bootcamp_regression
A detailed bootcamp in Python focused on the mathematical implementation of regression algorithms.

# Introduction
During this bootcamp, I realized in python with numpy and pandas (the use of the sklearn library was forbidden) the implementation of 5 different types of regression algorithms:
- a linear regression model
- a linear multivariate regression model
- a polynomial regression model
- a polynomial multivariate regression nmodel
- a logistic multivariate model

Other fondamental aspects of machine learning, such as the confusion matrix, the use of metrics and regularization techniques were also explored.


# Some resulats

Linear regresison model with its cost function varying in function of the model parameters:
